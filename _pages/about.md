I am an undergraduate student at [the Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Shengjin Wang](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/wangshengjin/en/index/2817/list/index.htm) and [Dr. Yali Li](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/liyali/en/index.htm). Interested in unraveling the principles of neuronal population, I am working on the topic of application of deep learning in neuroscience.

For more information, please check out my [CV](files/CV.pdf).

Projects
======
The Algonauts Project 2023
------
Trained an ConvNeXt-based encoding model with Feature Pyramid Network and sparse dictionary learning, in order to predict the fMRI signals of human brain with single-trail images viewed by the subjects, caption of the input images and behaviour data of the subjects as input. The model ranked 5th on the final leader board of the [competition](http://algonauts.csail.mit.edu/challenge.html).
